## Contributing ü§ù
JellyFM is currently just a small project for myself to keep coding. As I am no professional coder, your feedback on my code is always welcome. 
I devide the issues in the milestones based on the months. I intend to also release updates at the beginning of the month. You can see on what issues I am focusing by filtering on the months milestone. 
The milestones are merely a guide for myself. Feel free to work on any issue you like. 

The app currently only use Swift and uses alamofire to make requests to the server.
